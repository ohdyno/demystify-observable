# demystify-observable
Creating RxJS Observable from scratch to demystify it for myself

## Context
I'm exposed to a good amount of RxJS's `Observables` when I am working on an Angular project. Rather than having a cursory understanding of `Observables`
through reading documentation. I haven decided to create it from scratch, following the [Observable Guide](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/observable).

## Outcome
To develop comfort in using `Observables`.

## Anti-Goal
- To create a production-ready `Observable` library.
- To follow the same interface as designed in RxJS.
